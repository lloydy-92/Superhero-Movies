Independent two-sample t-test:<br/>
P-value between Global Box Office Revenue for Major Distributors and Other distributors: 0.000317<br/><br/>
Looking at Figure 1, is it clear to see that the box office revenue of superhero movies produced by major distributors is vastly greater than that of independent distributors. This is backed up by the very small p-value from the t-test between the two of 0.000317, which is strong evidence to point towards that this difference is significant. These observations are to be expected in theory, as major distributors have significantly more marketing and distribution power for their movies, and so can encourage more people to go and watch it in theatres. They are also very much more likely to own the IP of existing franchises that fans like, and so those fans will more often than not go and watch a movie they are fimiliar with, rather than a completely original IP they have never encountered before.


## 2) Has the average worldwide box office revenue of superhero movies increased over the years?

The conclusion as to whether average revenue generated for superhero movies has increased over time or not is different depending on how frequent the time intervals are. For example, in Figure 2, it can be clearly seen that there is a steady increase in average box office revenue across each decade. However, in Figure 3, when plotting the average revenue per year for every year that shows up in the dataset, the correlation, whilst also positive, is much weaker and less noticeable than that of Figure 2. There appears to be great inconsistency and increased variation in revenue as the individual years go on.

Independent two-sample t-test:<br/>
P-value between Global Box Office Revenue for Original Movies and Movies based on existing IPs: 0.00317<br/><br/>
Like with the box office revenue between distributors for Hypothesis 1 shown in Figure 1, Figure 4 gives strong and clear evidence that superhero movies based on existing IPs significantly out-perform totally original movie, with the p-value of 0.000317 again from the t-test also solidifying this argument. The reasoning behind this is likely similar as to what was stated for Hypothesis 1; that fans and consumers prefer to watch films based on franchises they have already heard of rather than taking a risk with a completely new story.


## 4) Do movie sequels/reboots and remakes tend to out-perform their original counterparts?

Figure 5 shows mixed results in terms of box office revenue. For example, some franchises, such as The Lone Ranger, Tron, and Sonic the Hedgehog, show that their more recently released sequel counterparts significantly outperform the originals at the box office. However, most other franchises (e.g. The Toxic Avenger, The Crow, Universal Soldier, etc.) show a significant decrease in revenue over time as their seuqels/remakes/reboots were released. Some franchises show varied or no change in box office as well. For example, for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, the latter two movies released in 2014 and 2016 respectively outperformed their 90s originals, however with the same pattern as the second of each two set of movies performing worse than the one that came before it. Other franchises, such as M Night Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' trilogy, and the Godzilla x Kong franchise, show that all movies within performed similar at the box office and have no clear pattern in variation between movies respectively.


# Overall Conclusion
The analysis reveals that superhero movies backed by major distributors and based on existing intellectual properties consistently achieve higher global box office revenue. While revenue has generally increased over time, the trend is most evident when viewed across broader time intervals, such as decades. Sequel and reboot performance varies by franchise, with some outperforming originals and others underperforming, highlighting the complexity of audience reception and brand fatigue. Overall, established franchises and studio power remain strong predictors of financial success in the superhero genre. It is also worth noting that box office revenue is not the sole factor when determining whether the audience reception of a movie was overall positive or not. Statistics such as individual ratings and/or reviews can allow fans to more specifically express their opinion on certain movies, regardless of the revenue it brought in.
